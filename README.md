# This repository shows the implementation of Yolov5 and also the export of Yolov5 in [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) and [Torchscript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) for Mobile Devices. 

**This Repository shows the example of 4 Yolov5 Version as well the conversion to [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) and CoreML(experimental).**

**Version of Yolov5**
- 1. Yolov5-small
- 2. Yolov5 - medium
- 3. Yolov5 - large
- 4. Yolov5 - xlarge

**IN THIS REPOSITORY I HAVE MAINLY FOCUSED ON YOLOv5-XLarge. Feel Free to experiment by changing the config file.**

**Usage**
- Install the dependencies
 ### pip install -r requirement.txt

- Generate the Yolov5-xlarge model, convert the model in ONNX and export the model using torchscript
### python main_file.py
